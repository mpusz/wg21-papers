# ISO C++ Committee (WG21) Papers

That page hosts the list of WG21 papers that I created or co-authored with other C++ experts.
Source versions of those papers can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/mpusz/wg21_papers).

## What is ISO C++ Committee?

Information on the ISO C++ Committee is available on [the Committee site](https://isocpp.org/std/the-committee).

## About me

Hi, my name is **Mateusz Pusz**. You can find more about me on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mpusz)
account. To make a long story short I am doing C++ for fun and living for many years now.
I am a C++ consultant, trainer, and evangelist focused on Modern C++. I am also the founder
of [Train IT](http://train-it.eu) created to provide C++ training and consulting services
all over the world. My main areas of interest and expertise are code performance, low
latency, stability, and security.

I am an active voting member of the **ISO C++ Committee (WG21)** and this page is dedicated
to this activity.
