# Introduction

Several groups in the ISO C++ Committee reviewed the "P1935: A C++ Approach to Physical Units"
[@P1935R2] proposal in Belfast 2019 and Prague 2020. All those groups
expressed interest in the potential standardization of such a library and encouraged further
work. The authors also got valuable initial feedback that highly influenced the design of
the V2 version of the [@MP-UNITS] library.

In the following years, the library's authors scoped on getting more feedback from the production
and design and developed version 2 of the [@MP-UNITS] library that resolves the issues raised
by the users and Committee members. The features and interfaces of this version are close to
being the best we can get with the current version of the C++ language standard.

This paper is authored by not only the [@MP-UNITS] library developers but also by the authors
of other actively maintained similar libraries on the market and other active members of
the C++ physical quantities and units community who have worked on this subject for many years.
We join our forces to say with one voice that we deeply care about standardizing such
features as a part of the C++ Standard Library. Based on our long and broad experience in
the subject, we agree that the interfaces we will provide in the upcoming proposals are
the best we can get today in the C++ language.


# About Authors

## Mateusz Pusz

Mateusz got interested in the physical units subject while contributing to the [@LK8000]
Tactical Flight Computer Open Source project over 10 years ago. The project's code was far
from being "safe" in the C++ sense, and this is when Mateusz started to explore alternatives.

Through the following years, he tried to use several existing solutions, which were always
far from being user-friendly, so he also tried to write a better framework a few times from
scratch by himself.

Finally, with the availability of brand new Concepts TS in the gcc-7, the [@MP-UNITS] project
was created. It was designed with safety and user experience in mind. After many years
of working on the project, the [@MP-UNITS] library is probably the most modern and complete
solution in the C++ market.

Through the last few years, Mateusz has put much effort into building a community around physical
units. He provided many talks and workshops on this subject at various C++ conferences.
He also approached the authors of other actively maintained libraries to get their feedback
and invited them to work together to find and agree on the best solution for the C++ language.
This paper is the result of those actions.

# Motivation

This chapter describes why we believe that physical quantities and units should be part of
a C++ Standard Library.

## Safety

It is no longer only the space industry or experienced pilots that benefit from the autonomous
operations of some machines. We live in a world where more and more ordinary people trust
machines with their lives daily. In the near future, we will be allowed to sleep while our
car autonomously drives us home from a late party. As a result, much more C++ engineers are
expected to write life-critical software today than it was a few years ago.Unfortunately,
there is insufficient training and experience in that domain, and the C++ language does not
change fast enough to enforce safe-by-construction code.

One of the areas where C++ can significantly improve the safety of applications being written
by thousands of developers is introducing a type-safe, well-tested, standardized way to handle
physical quantities and their units. The rationale for this is that people tend to have problems
communicating or using proper units both in the code and in daily life. Numerous
expensive failures and accidents happened because of using an invalid unit or a quantity type.

The most famous and probably the most expensive example in the software engineering domain is
the Mars Climate Orbiter that in 1999 failed to enter Mars orbit and crashed while entering
its atmosphere [@MARS_ORBITER]. This is not the only example here. People tend to confuse units
quite often. We see similar errors occurring in various domains over the years:

- On October 12, 1492, Christopher Columbus unintentionally discovered America because during
  his travel preparations, he mixed the Arabic mile with a Roman mile, which led to the wrong estimation
  of the equator and his expected travel distance [@COLUMBUS]
- Air Canada Flight 143 ran out of fuel on July 23, 1983, at an altitude of 41 000 feet
  (12 000 metres), midway through the flight because the fuel had been calculated in pounds
  instead of kilograms by the ground crew [@GIMLI_GLIDER]
- On April 15, 1999, Korean Air Cargo Flight 6316 crashed due to a miscommunication between
  pilots about desired flight altitude [@FLIGHT_6316]
- In February 2001, the Zoo crew built an enclosure for Clarence the Tortoise with a weight of
  250 pounds instead of 250 kilograms [@CLARENCE]
- In December 2003, one of the roller coaster’s cars at Tokyo Disneyland’s Space Mountain attraction
  suddenly derailed due to a broken axle caused by the confusion after upgrading the specification
  from imperial to metric units [@DISNEY]
- During construction of the Hochrheinbrücke bridge, connects the small German town of Laufenburg
  with Swiss Laufenburg, the construction team made a sign error that resulted in the discrepancy
  of 54 cm between the two outer ends of the bridge [@HOCHRHEINBRÜCKE]
- An American company sold a shipment of wild rice to a Japanese customer, quoting a price of
  39 cents per pound, but the customer thought the quote was for 39 cents per kilogram [@WILD_RICE]
- A whole set of medication dose errors...

The safety subject is so vast and essential by itself that we dedicated a separate paper **P????**
that discusses all the nuances in detail.

## Vocabulary types

We standardized many library features mostly used in the implementation details
(fmt, ranges, random-number generators, etc.). However, we believe that the most important
role of the C++ Standard is to provide a standardized way of communication between different
vendors.

Let's imagine a world without `std::string` or `std::vector`. Every vendor has their version
of it, and of course, they are completely incompatible with each other. As a result, when someone
needs to integrate software from different vendors, it turns out to be nearly impossible.

Introducing `std::chrono::duration` and `std::chrono::time_point` improved the interfaces a lot,
but time is only one of many quantities that we deal with in our software on a daily basis.
We desperately need to be able to express more quantities and units in a standardized way so
different libraries get means to communicate with each other.

## Certification

Mission/life-critical projects or those for embedded devices often can only use external libraries
that are officially certified (i.e. MISRA). This is a huge issue for those companies as those
typically are natural users of physical quantities and units library.
<!-- I'm having trouble understanding the previous paragraph.
IIUC, those certified libraries have interfaces with units, but are not type-safe. -->

## Complex and complicated

For example, suppose vendors can't use an Open Source library in a production project for
the above reasons. In that case, they are forced to write their own abstractions by themselves.
Besides being not cost and time-effective, it also happens that writing a physical quantities and
units library by yourself is far from easy. Doing this is complex and complicated, especially for
engineers who are not experts in the domain. There are many exceptional corner cases to cover
that most developers do not even realize before falling into a trap in production. As
a result, companies either use really simple and unsafe numeric wrappers or abandon the effort totally
and just use `double` to express quantity values which lead to safety issues.

## Standardizing existing practice

Plenty of physical units libraries have been on the market for many years. Through the years,
we have learned the best practices for handling specific cases in the domain. Various products
may have different scopes and support different C++ versions. Still, taking that aside, they use
really similar concepts, types, and operations under the hood. We know how to do those things already.

The authors of this paper developed and delivered multiple successful C++ libraries for this domain.
They joined forces and are working together to propose the best physical quantities and units
library we can get with the latest version of the C++ language. They spend their private time and
efforts hoping that the ISO C++ Committee will be willing to include such a feature in
the C++ Standard Library.


# Look and Feel

_Note: The code examples presented in this paper may not exactly reflect the final interface
design that is going to be proposed in the following papers. We are still doing some small
fine-tuning to improve the library._

As no papers on the physical quantities and units interfaces have been submitted so far,
to allow the reader to better understand the features and scope of the library this chapter
presents a few simple examples.

## Hello Units

This simple example serves as a showcase of various features available in the [@MP-UNITS] library.

```cpp
#include <mp-units/format.h>
#include <mp-units/ostream.h>
#include <mp-units/systems/international/international.h>
#include <mp-units/systems/isq/isq.h>
#include <mp-units/systems/si/si.h>
#include <iostream>

using namespace mp_units;

constexpr QuantityOf<isq::speed> auto avg_speed(QuantityOf<isq::length> auto d,
                                                QuantityOf<isq::time> auto t)
{
  return d / t;
}

int main()
{
  using namespace mp_units::si::unit_symbols;
  using namespace mp_units::international::unit_symbols;

  constexpr quantity v1 = 110 * (km / h);
  constexpr quantity v2 = 70 * mph;
  constexpr quantity v3 = avg_speed(220. * km, 2 * h);
  constexpr quantity v4 = avg_speed(isq::distance(140. * mi), 2 * isq::duration[h]);
  constexpr quantity v5 = v3.in(m / s);
  constexpr quantity v6 = value_cast<m / s>(v4);
  constexpr quantity v7 = value_cast<int>(v6);

  std::cout << v1 << '\n';                                   // 110 km/h
  std::cout << v2 << '\n';                                   // 70 mi/h
  std::cout << std::format("{}", v3) << '\n';                // 110 km/h
  std::cout << std::format("{:*^14}", v4) << '\n';           // ***70 mi/h****
  std::cout << std::format("{:%Q in %q}", v5) << '\n';       // 30.5556 in m/s
  std::cout << std::format("{0:%Q} in {0:%q}", v6) << '\n';  // 31.2928 in m/s
  std::cout << std::format("{:%Q}", v7) << '\n';             // 31
}
```

## Bridge across the Rhine

The following example codifies the history of a famous accident during the construction of a bridge across
the Rhine River between the German and Swiss parts of the town Laufenburg [@HOCHRHEINBRÜCKE].
It also nicely presents how [the Affine Space is being modeled in the library](https://mpusz.github.io/mp-units/latest/users_guide/framework_basics/the_affine_space/).


```cpp
#include <mp-units/ostream.h>
#include <mp-units/quantity_point.h>
#include <mp-units/systems/isq/space_and_time.h>
#include <mp-units/systems/si/si.h>
#include <iostream>

using namespace mp_units;
using namespace mp_units::si::unit_symbols;

constexpr struct amsterdam_sea_level : absolute_point_origin<isq::altitude> {
} amsterdam_sea_level;

constexpr struct mediterranean_sea_level : relative_point_origin<amsterdam_sea_level + isq::altitude(-27 * cm)> {
} mediterranean_sea_level;

using altitude_DE = quantity_point<isq::altitude[m], amsterdam_sea_level>;
using altitude_CH = quantity_point<isq::altitude[m], mediterranean_sea_level>;

template<auto R, typename Rep>
std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, quantity_point<R, altitude_DE::point_origin, Rep> alt)
{
  return os << alt.quantity_from_origin() << " AMSL(DE)";
}

template<auto R, typename Rep>
std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, quantity_point<R, altitude_CH::point_origin, Rep> alt)
{
  return os << alt.quantity_from_origin() << " AMSL(CH)";
}

int main()
{
  // expected bridge altitude in a specific reference system
  quantity_point expected_bridge_alt = amsterdam_sea_level + isq::altitude(330 * m);

  // some nearest landmark altitudes on both sides of the river
  // equal but not equal ;-)
  altitude_DE landmark_alt_DE = altitude_DE::point_origin + 300 * m;
  altitude_CH landmark_alt_CH = altitude_CH::point_origin + 300 * m;

  // artifical deltas from landmarks of the bridge base on both sides of the river
  quantity delta_DE = isq::height(3 * m);
  quantity delta_CH = isq::height(-2 * m);

  // artificial altitude of the bridge base on both sides of the river
  quantity_point bridge_base_alt_DE = landmark_alt_DE + delta_DE;
  quantity_point bridge_base_alt_CH = landmark_alt_CH + delta_CH;

  // artificial height of the required bridge pilar height on both sides of the river
  quantity bridge_pilar_height_DE = expected_bridge_alt - bridge_base_alt_DE;
  quantity bridge_pilar_height_CH = expected_bridge_alt - bridge_base_alt_CH;

  std::cout << "Bridge pillars height:\n";
  std::cout << "- Germany:     " << bridge_pilar_height_DE << '\n';
  std::cout << "- Switzerland: " << bridge_pilar_height_CH << '\n';

  // artificial bridge altitude on both sides of the river in both systems
  quantity_point bridge_road_alt_DE = bridge_base_alt_DE + bridge_pilar_height_DE;
  quantity_point bridge_road_alt_CH = bridge_base_alt_CH + bridge_pilar_height_CH;

  std::cout << "Bridge road altitude:\n";
  std::cout << "- Germany:     " << bridge_road_alt_DE << '\n';
  std::cout << "- Switzerland: " << bridge_road_alt_CH << '\n';

  std::cout << "Bridge road altitude relative to the Amsterdam Sea Level:\n";
  std::cout << "- Germany:     " << bridge_road_alt_DE - amsterdam_sea_level << '\n';
  std::cout << "- Switzerland: " << bridge_road_alt_CH - amsterdam_sea_level << '\n';
}
```

The above provides the following text output:

```text
Bridge pillars height:
- Germany:     27 m
- Switzerland: 3227 cm
Bridge road altitude:
- Germany:     330 m AMSL(DE)
- Switzerland: 33027 cm AMSL(CH)
Bridge road altitude relative to the Amsterdam Sea Level:
- Germany:     330 m
- Switzerland: 33000 cm
```

## Storage Tank

Our last example estimates the process of filling the storage tank with some contents. It presents:

- [the importance of supporting more than one distinct quantity for the same kind](https://mpusz.github.io/mp-units/2.0/users_guide/framework_basics/systems_of_quantities/#system-of-quantities-is-not-only-about-kinds),
- [Faster-than-lightspeed constants](https://mpusz.github.io/mp-units/2.0/users_guide/framework_basics/faster_than_lightspeed_constants/),
- how easy it is to [add custom quantity types](https://mpusz.github.io/mp-units/2.0/users_guide/framework_basics/systems_of_quantities/#defining-quantities)
when needed,
- interoperability with `std::chrono::duration`.

namespace {

using namespace mp_units;
using namespace mp_units::si::unit_symbols;

// add a custom quantity type of kind isq::length
inline constexpr struct horizontal_length : quantity_spec<isq::length> {} horizontal_length;

inline constexpr auto g = 1 * si::standard_gravity;
inline constexpr auto air_density = isq::mass_density(1.225 * (kg / m3));

class StorageTank {
  quantity<horizontal_area[m2]> base_;
  quantity<isq::height[m]> height_;
  quantity<isq::mass_density[kg / m3]> density_ = air_density;
public:
  constexpr StorageTank(const quantity<horizontal_area[m2]>& base, const quantity<isq::height[m]>& height) :
      base_(base), height_(height)
  {
  }

  constexpr void set_contents_density(const quantity<isq::mass_density[kg / m3]>& density)
  {

    density_ = density;
  }

  [[nodiscard]] constexpr QuantityOf<isq::weight> auto filled_weight() const
  {
    const auto volume = isq::volume(base_ * height_);
    const QuantityOf<isq::mass> auto mass = density_ * volume;
    return isq::weight(mass * g);
  }

  [[nodiscard]] constexpr quantity<isq::height[m]> fill_level(const quantity<isq::mass[kg]>& measured_mass) const

};

}  // namespace


int main()
{
  const auto height = isq::height(200 * mm);
  auto tank = RectangularStorageTank(horizontal_length(1'000 * mm), isq::width(500 * mm), height);
  tank.set_contents_density(1'000 * isq::mass_density[kg / m3]);

  const auto duration = std::chrono::seconds{200};
  const quantity fill_time = value_cast<int>(quantity{duration});  // time since starting fill
  const quantity measured_mass = 20. * kg;                         // measured mass at fill_time

  const auto fill_level = tank.fill_level(measured_mass);
  const auto spare_capacity = tank.spare_capacity(measured_mass);
  const auto filled_weight = tank.filled_weight();

  const QuantityOf<isq::mass_change_rate> auto input_flow_rate = measured_mass / fill_time;
  const QuantityOf<isq::speed> auto float_rise_rate = fill_level / fill_time;
  const QuantityOf<isq::time> auto fill_time_left = (height / fill_level - 1 * one) * fill_time;

  const auto fill_ratio = fill_level / height;

  std::cout << std::format("fill height at {} = {} ({} full)\n", fill_time, fill_level, fill_ratio.in(percent));
  std::cout << std::format("fill weight at {} = {} ({})\n", fill_time, filled_weight, filled_weight.in(N));
  std::cout << std::format("spare capacity at {} = {}\n", fill_time, spare_capacity);
  std::cout << std::format("input flow rate = {}\n", input_flow_rate);
  std::cout << std::format("float rise rate = {}\n", float_rise_rate);
  std::cout << std::format("tank full E.T.A. at current flow rate = {}\n", fill_time_left.in(s));
}
```

The above code outputs:

```text
fill height at 200 s = 0.04 m (20 % full)
fill weight at 200 s = 100 g₀ kg (980.665 N)
spare capacity at 200 s = 0.08 m³
input flow rate = 0.1 kg/s
float rise rate = 0.0002 m/s
tank full E.T.A. at current flow rate = 800 s
```

# Plan For Standardization

Having physical quantities and units support in C++ would be extremely useful for many C++ developers,
and ideally, we should ship it in C++29. We believe that it can be done, and we propose a plan
to get there. The plan below is, of course, not an irrevocable commitment. If things get delayed
or controversial for whatever reason, physical quantities and units (or some parts of it)
will miss the train and we will have to wait three more years. However, having a clear plan approved
by LEWG will help to keep the efforts on track.

<!-- LWG will no doubt have their hands full with things like Executors.
But once the C++29 WP is open for merging, it'd be best to get the papers merged ASAP.
And then have MSVC, Clang, and GCC's stdlib to implement them ASAP.
That way, we can get early adoption and UX before C++29 ships, in case any issue pops up.
Or maybe just target a TS, and strive to get those stdlib implementations to implement them. -->
